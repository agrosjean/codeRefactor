# codeRefactor

1.Description

This project aims to review both HTML and CSS page and figure out if every links works and how to make it less repetitive and cleaner.

2.Process 

First,I verified if all links on the “Header” worked. I noticed that the (search-engine-optimization) link wasn’t functioning because in the “body,” it was missing the ID.

Second,I noticed that <div> tag was repetitive and messy. I rearrange it byusing “HTML Semantic” elements, such as <Main> & <Section>& <Article> & <Footer>. It allows the page to be moredescriptive and organize.

Third, on the CSS page, it alerted me that many of the “Classes” had the sameproperties. The issue was that they all had different names given. To make surenot to repeat me, I gave the same “class name” depending on the part of theHTML & CSS page for it to match.
